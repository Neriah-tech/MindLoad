# MindLoad
MindLoad is a no-code / low-code study support prototype that helps students organize academic schedules and study resources in one website. The system uses structured data inputs like calendars or study guides and simple automated workflows to generate relevant study tips and reminders. 
This project is an early-stage prototype focused on workflow design, data handling, and automation logic rather than custom backend development or advanced AI models.
## HOW TO RUN 
1) Open the project in the platform workspace (Glide)
2) Navigate through the screens or workflow steps to see how schedules and study resources are organized.
3) Upload example data files, like a student schedule CSV or a study tips document, to test how the system displays relevant information.
4) Click on the buttons or interact with the workflow to see study reminders and suggested tips appear.
5) You can explore different paths in the workflow .
6) No coding is required—everything is visual and interactive in the platform.
